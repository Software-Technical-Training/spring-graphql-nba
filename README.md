# spring-graphql-nba
Basic spring graphql application using an in memory H2 database and spring jdbc

# GraphQL setup
Under src/main/resources, create nba.graphqls file and add the schema for types and queries <br> 
Enable the graphiql web interface in application.properties<br>
Create a basic @Controller class and use @QueryMapping to map the graph ql query<br>

# H2 db setup and enabling jdbc
Define schema.sql to create tables and data.sql to insert some values<br>
Create a data source @Configuration class and define @Bean data source<br>
Create entities, row mappers to map from db to java class and DAOs (@Repository) to fetch data from DB using @JdbcTemplate<br>
Define h2 db properties in application.properties and disable jpa hibernate as we will use pure spring jdbc only for this project<br>
Inject the DAO into the controller to get the data from DB when the graphql query is issued from the graphql web console<br>
H2 Console http://localhost:8080/h2-console <br>
Use jdbc:h2:mem:testdb as JDBC URL
